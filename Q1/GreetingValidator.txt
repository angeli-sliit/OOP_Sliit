Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter their name and age, validates the inputs,
 and prints a greeting message to the console. If the user enters an invalid age, the program
 should throw a custom exception called “InvalidInputException”. The program should be
 implemented as follows:
 Create a custom exception class called “InvalidInputException” that printout the error message
 “Invalid age: Age should be a positive integer less than or equal to 120” if the age is a negative
 number or greater than 120.
 Create another class “GreetingValidator” to get the user inputs through the main method. The
 program should prompt the user to enter their name and age.
 The program should validate the age by checking that it is a positive integer less than or equal
 to 120. If the age is invalid, the program should throw an InvalidInputException.
 If age is valid, the program should print a greeting message to the console that includes the
 user's name and age.
