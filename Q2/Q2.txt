Write a program that prompts the user to enter a telephone number as a String, then 
performs the following validation using two different custom exception classes as 
follows.  

• InvalidPhoneNumberDigits, is an exception class that prints out the error 
message “The phone number must have exactly 10 digits.”. If the number of 
characters in the user input for the telephone is not exactly 10.  

• InvalidPhoneNumberStart, is an exception class that prints out the error 
message “The phone number must start with 0”. If the first character of the 
user is not equal to 0. 

Write another class called DemoApp to get the user input for the telephone number 
and then validate it for the above two conditions. If the input has one or more 
custom exception, you should have a proper try-catch statements to handle the 
exception.
